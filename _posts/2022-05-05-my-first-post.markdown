Hello all! Hola! This is my first post using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Thanks GitHub for this amazing work. It has been a long time to deciding start this journey. I have a lot of ideas on my mind... want to say, explain or share this or this, but, honestly, sometimes I'm too afraid about what people really expects.

Hope all visitors find something -even small- worth; it's more about share and learn, it's about to make a close relationship between you and I.

Well, it's enough on this post. Have an amazing day,

Heberth
